## File Structure

- **app.py**: Main application file where the Flask application is created and routes are defined.

- **static/**: This directory houses static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, images, and other assets used by the application to style and interact with the user interface.

  Example files:
  - `style.css`: Defines the styles for the application's HTML elements.
  - `script.js`: Contains client-side JavaScript code for interactive features.
  - `logo.png`: An image file used as the application's logo.

- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates that define the structure and layout of the application's views. These templates are rendered by Flask to generate dynamic HTML content displayed to the user.

  Example files:
  - `index.html`: The main homepage template.
  - `layout.html`: A base template that other templates extend or include for consistent layout and structure.
